# Vibranium

> Developer tools for building decentralized applications.

This project is highly inspired by tools like [Embark](https://embark.status.im) and [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com) and serves as my personal playground to learn the Rust programming language but also create something useful.

**Super early stages, far from production ready**
